# An individual-based model of range expansions

A Netlogo model written for my projects on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of range expansions.

At the moment (v0.5, March 2020), it allows for both neutral genetic diversity and dispersal to evolve, but the latter is not correctly implemented yet and can (and should) be turned off for most applications. A better implementation of phenotypic evolution will come later

For details on how the model is set up, see Info pane in-model
